# EzCharts
Intelligents and dynamics generic charts

##Why intelligents?

EzCharts could aggregate data to maximize the chart's lisibility.

##Bar Chart

eg:

BarsChart: Specifying aggregate true into the configuration will build only one aggregated bar with all the tiny value irrelevant to dump on their own.
The aggregated value limit could be specified; eg: aggregate all value under 10

;Or could be automaticly computed by width's chart/width'bar

Some callback are also could also being customize.

click on a bar

click on label

hook before use the data (to transform it)
